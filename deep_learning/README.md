## Deep Learning

This repo contains step by step implementations of neural nets in numpy; first a very simple breakdown of a three layer network with two input units, one hidden unit, and one output unit, with sigmoid activations on the hidden and output units. Second a more complex implementation, two layer neural network with a single output node which is used for a regression problem: predicting bike ridership. This example implements a sigmoid activation function, forward pass, back propoagation algorithm, in
calculating the output error. These examples are based on work I have done in Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program. 

This repo also contains neural networks implmented in Tensorflow. The Numpy implementations are necessary to understand how deep learning works at a low level, which allow us to contruct more complex nets in Tensorflow.
