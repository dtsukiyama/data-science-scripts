## Deep Learning

This repo contains step by step implementations of neural nets in Numpy; first a very simple breakdown of a three layer network with two input units, one hidden unit, and one output unit, with sigmoid activations on the hidden and output units. Second a more complex implementation, two layer neural network with a single output node which is used for a regression problem: predicting bike ridership. This example implements a sigmoid activation function, forward pass, back propoagation algorithm, in
calculating the output error. These examples are based on work I have done in Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program. The Numpy implementations are necessary to understand how deep learning works at a low level, which allow us to contruct more complex nets in Tensorflow. 

This repo also contains neural networks implmented in Tensorflow that build on the Numpy networks. The Tensorflow Neural Net Regression I built implements my Numpy network in Tensorflow, but there I have implemented two hidden layers and early stopping.
